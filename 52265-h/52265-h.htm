3</span><i>OBSERVATIONS</i><br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON AN</span><br />
ANONYMOUS PAMPHLET.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many circumstances which
might have induced a friend of the Bible Society to refrain from
noticing a work, under the circumstances of the present
pamphlet.&nbsp; And, had it strictly adhered to its title, and
simply stated the reasons why a churchman might properly refuse
to subscribe to this institution, it would probably have remained
unnoticed by me.&nbsp; It might, in that case, have been hoped,
that statements which are unacknowledged would not have been
believed, and the reasonings of the work might have been left,
without much alarm, to do their worst.&nbsp; But, as it has been
observed to me, that the very circumstance of putting even the
most improbable statements in print, invests them with a species
of authority; and as there are many persons still unacquainted
with the nature and operations of the Bible Society, and who,
therefore, may mistake the boldness of assertion in this little
work for the confidence of truth, I have yielded to the advice of
some of my friends, in attempting to reply to it.&nbsp; Before I
proceed, however, to this reply, I will beg leave to make a
single observation on the <i>temper</i> in which this attempt
will, I trust, be made.</p>
<p>The author of this pamphlet has, in the first page of his
work, reprobated the &ldquo;arrogant and dogmatical style&rdquo;
of his opponents; and, in the conclusion of it, he has called
their <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>measures &ldquo;wicked, cruel, and
unchristian.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is my hope, that I shall not fall
into the same error.&nbsp; I desire &ldquo;nothing to extenuate,
nor set down aught in malice;&rdquo; to state facts, not from the
mere authority of the parties concerned in this controversy, but
upon that of the most authentic documents; and, should I fail to
convince my readers, it is my confident intention not at once to
conclude their opinions &ldquo;unchristian&rdquo; and
&ldquo;cruel,&rdquo; because they differ from my own; hard words,
I may venture to say, ought not to be the weapons of our warfare,
and I trust they never will be of mine.&nbsp; I desire to
remember the declaration of our Lord, &ldquo;they that take the
sword, shall perish by the sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I may be permitted also to add, that in entering upon the
consideration of this question, I consider myself as approaching
a subject of the highest importance.&nbsp; When I am canvassing
the merits of an instrument for circulating the Word of God over
every part of the world, I tremble lest the ark should suffer in
my hands; and I desire to go out to the warfare, not so much with
a &ldquo;sword and a shield&rdquo; of human fabrication, as,
&ldquo;in the name of the Lord,&rdquo; for the circulation of
whose Word I wish to contend.</p>
<p>This pamphlet is entitled &ldquo;Reasons why a Churchman may
with great justice refuse to subscribe to the Bible
Society;&rdquo; and the reasons which are assigned may be said to
be of three kinds: First, <i>That a better Society</i>, <i>of a
like kind</i>, <i>exists in the church</i>; Secondly, <i>That the
Bible Society does not answer to the professions and praises of
its advocates</i>; Thirdly, <i>That it is injurious to the
established church</i>.&nbsp; Upon each of these points I shall
now venture to make a few observations.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, It is said, <i>That a better Society</i>, <i>of
a like kind</i>, <i>exists in the church</i>.&nbsp; The Society
to which the author alludes, is that established more than 100
years since, which is called the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge.&nbsp; Its object is threefold: To distribute Bibles;
also, Prayer Books and Tracts; and to send <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>Missionaries.&nbsp; Every member of this Society is
obliged to give good security that he is a churchman, and there
is no way in which, by its means, any other denomination of
christians can be benefited, but by the hands of churchmen.</p>
<p>The advantages of this institution over the Bible Society
which the author endeavours to establish are four.&nbsp;
<i>First</i>, It is a <i>Society which consists entirely of
churchmen</i>; <i>Secondly</i>, Bibles can be procured in it at a
<i>cheaper rate</i>; <i>Thirdly</i>, The Bibles which it issues
are more <i>useful</i>; <i>Fourthly</i>, It furnishes <i>Prayer
Books and Tracts</i>.</p>
<p>As the Society whose cause the author exclusively advocates,
is a society of churchmen, he maintains that, by its extension
and prevalence, no variety of interpretation in essential points
would prevail, and therefore no confusion be introduced amongst
the unlearned.&nbsp; All churchmen would, he conceives, teach the
same truths in the same manner.&nbsp; But, is this
accurate?&nbsp; Is there such a perfect accordance of opinion
amongst churchmen?&nbsp; If, for instance, Dr. Marat and Mr.
Scott, each of them churchmen, each of them members of the Old
Society, and each of them men of respectability, were to
circulate Bibles, with their own interpretations, would an exact
conformity of opinion be produced?&nbsp; Assuredly not.&nbsp;
What, then, is the conclusion from this?&nbsp; That of churchmen,
it can only be said as of churchmen and dissenters, they agree in
the authority of the Bible; but there is no complete agreement as
to the interpretations of the Bible.&nbsp; If churchmen, who are
members of the Old Society, widely disagree upon essential points
in the interpretation of the Bible, even the Old Society is no
guarantee for unity.&nbsp; A person, to be quite right, on the
principle of the author, should subscribe exclusively to a
Society, where each person would agree to promulgate only the
same interpretation of scripture; and where, it may be asked,
would such a Society be found?</p>
<p>But, secondly, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge
is affirmed to be best, because &ldquo;<i>it procures Bibles at a
</i><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span><i>cheaper rate</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is meant by this
assertion I cannot discover, unless the author designs to say,
that Bibles cost less to that Society in their original
purchase.&nbsp; This would be very inaccurate, as each are
purchased at the same markets&mdash;the markets to which the sale
is confined by legislative enactment.&nbsp; But the author
proceeds to a statement of <i>facts</i> on this subject, which it
may be well to consider.&nbsp; It is said, page 7, &ldquo;A 12mo
Non-pareil Bible is allowed to the subscribers for Promoting
Christian Knowledge for 3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, but the British
and Foreign Bible Society expects from its subscribers
4<i>s.</i>, 6<i>d.</i>, for the same edition.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to
this statement, I would say, in the first place, that it is
grossly incorrect.&nbsp; By every printed document of the Bible
Society, this Bible, which is stated to be charged to its
subscribers at 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, is offered to them at
3<i>s.</i> 7<i>s.</i>&nbsp; But it may yet be said, The Bible
from the Old Society is then at all events cheaper than that of
the New: Why are not the prices of the New Society reduced?&nbsp;
I answer, that in all the instances, the Bibles of the New
Society are within a few pence as cheap as in the Old.&nbsp; But,
if not, a most satisfactory reason may be given, in the
consideration of the object of the New Society, and of the means
it has adapted to pursue that object.&nbsp; Its object is simply
this, <i>to do the greatest possible good</i>.&nbsp; And, in
order to accomplish this, it determines to supply Bibles
precisely at the rate which may suit the convenience of
individuals, without impairing the general means of the Society;
to suit the exigencies of the poor on the one hand, and, on the
other, to obtain a suitable return for their money.&nbsp; An
exactly parallel case presents itself.&nbsp; The Society for the
relief of the Poor, in Spitalfields, are now selling rice at
three-pence per pound.&nbsp; Why, it might be asked, is the rice
not sold cheaper than this?&nbsp; It would be answered, because
the object is to do the greatest possible good.&nbsp; Three-pence
per pound is a price which the poor can afford to pay, and, by
receiving this instead of a less price, the Society may perhaps
be able to encounter the continued pressure of the times.&nbsp;
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Thus it is
with Bibles.&nbsp; The poor (as is evident from their free
purchase of them) can afford to pay what they now pay for Bibles,
and which is about one half of what they would pay in the shops;
whilst the Society is by this return enabled to supply Bibles
gratuitously to the destitute, and continue its operations
through the world.&nbsp; Nor is this all: One reason why the Old
Society originally made its prices so low, was, that it did not
allow its subscribers to <i>sell</i> their Bibles, even at
reduced prices, but constrained them to <i>give</i> them
away.&nbsp; The New Society first discovered the error of this
proceeding, and concluding that a poor man would be likely more
to value the Bible which was bought, than the Bible which was
given, recommended its subscribers as a general rule, rather to
sell than to give.&nbsp; Hence, amongst other advantages, its
subscribers might be justly called upon to pay to this Society a
higher price.&nbsp; It may be observed, that the Old Society has
now extended this privilege to its subscribers, and, on this
ground, it is privileged to raise its prices.</p>
<p>But not only, is it said, are the Bibles <i>cheaper</i>, but
they are <i>better</i>: <i>better</i>, because, at the Old
Society, may be had a <i>Bible with a commentary</i>, the lowest
price of which is fifty shillings.</p>
<p>Now it may be observed, that this argument does not very
happily square with the last.&nbsp; First, says our author, the
Bibles of the Old Society are better, because they are cheaper;
next, they are better, because they have a commentary costing
fifty shillings.&nbsp; One of these two arguments must be
surrendered.&nbsp; The Bibles cannot be at once cheaper, and cost
a price which excludes them from general circulation.&nbsp; But,
further, it may be said, that every argument which assumes the
importance of the commentary to the Society, assumes the accuracy
and value of the commentary itself.&mdash;Are all commentaries
then valuable?&mdash;Are there none which might be very dear at
fifty shillings?</p>
<p>But a fourth reason, it is said, for the superiority of the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, is, that it provides
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Prayer Books
and Religious Tracts.&nbsp; The friends of the Bible Society are
charged with saying, &ldquo;that the Bible, and the Bible alone,
is the religion of Protestants;&rdquo; and our author affirms,
that, but for the exertions of Dr. Marsh, the Prayer Book would
not have been circulated.</p>
<p>As to the first of these charges, the Society pleads
guilty.&nbsp; They say, what the immortal Chillingworth said
before them, They maintain the principle, for which their
ancestors died triumphantly under the axe of a Popish
executioner.&nbsp; As to the second, it appeared, upon a pretty
rigid scrutiny, that whereas many of the friends of the Bible
Society had made large demands upon the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge for <i>Prayer Books</i>, Dr. Marsh had
confined himself, in his own parish, to the circulation of a
little volume on the <i>Value of Tithes</i>.&nbsp; But let us
look at the subject a little more generally.</p>
<p>Of Tracts it may be said as of a commentary that the
connection of these with any Society must exceedingly limit its
extension, even amongst churchmen.&nbsp; Accordingly, these
Tracts have been stated in print by churchmen to be completely
inconsistent with one another; some have been called
&ldquo;heretical;&rdquo; some have been charged with involving
&ldquo;the worst errors of Popery.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, whatever may
be the merit of these Tracts, to call them, with our author,
&ldquo;sure and certain guides,&rdquo; is to affirm of them what
can be affirmed only of the Revelation of God.&nbsp; Indeed, if
there were no other objection to our author&rsquo;s statement,
there is this, that these infallible guides are in the
unfortunate habit of flatly contradicting each other.&nbsp; In
this case, who is to arbitrate between them?&nbsp; I know not
what arbitrator our author will propose.&nbsp; I should say the
Bible? and I should go on to draw this inference&mdash;subscribe
than to the Bible Society&mdash;and transmit the doctrine of
infallible &ldquo;guides&rsquo;&rdquo; in the first vessel from
Lowestoft to Rome.</p>
<p>I am sorry that I should have felt any obligation to draw up
what may bear even the semblance of a charge against the <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Society, at
Bartlett&rsquo;s Buildings, of which I am a member.&nbsp; That
Society has many merits, and in its own sphere is capable of
doing much good.&nbsp; But, when an attempt is made to canonize
this Society; to apply it to objects which it can never reach;
and to erect it on the ruins of a Society of wider basis and far
more extensive capabilities, it is difficult to be entirely
silent.&nbsp; It was heartily to be wished, that these two
Societies should never have been brought into invidious
comparison, for, in a comparison, one of them must fail; and,
which ever suffers, Christianity suffers with it, because the
promotion of Christianity is the object of both.&nbsp; As,
however, these two Societies have been brought into comparison,
by the author of these &ldquo;Reasons,&rdquo; it seems requisite
now to show, that the New Society has certain peculiar and
exclusive advantages, which justify churchmen in supporting
it.</p>
<p>In the first place, then, <i>the constitution of the Old
Society disqualified it from the universal supply of the Word of
God</i>.&nbsp; It had existed for near a century, and during that
time, I venture confidently to say, it had, even <i>at home</i>,
done little of what was necessary for the distribution of the
Scriptures; and, <i>abroad</i>, scarcely any thing at all.</p>
<p><i>At home</i>, when examinations were made as to the
circulation of the Scriptures in many parts of England,
especially in Lincolnshire, there were villages where the Bible
was alone to be found in the church; within about a mile of the
depository of the Old Society, full one half of the families were
without a copy of the Scriptures; in this diocese alone, it was
calculated that ten thousand families were destitute of the Word
of God; in that of Durham, seven thousand five hundred; and,
which is a certain proof of this assertion, since that time,
nearly one million five hundred thousand copies have been
distributed, principally in our own country, without, at the same
time, the demand for the Scriptures being by any means
supplied.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span><i>Abroad</i>, the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge has been able to effect still less.&nbsp; It had,
indeed, only in one instance, attempted the distribution of the
Scriptures.&nbsp; This was in the year 1720, when it printed, but
not altogether at its own charge, an edition of the Psalms and
the New Testament in the Arabic language.&nbsp; And such was the
want of facilities for foreign operations, that, till lately, a
part of that edition was mouldering in the cellars of the
institution.&nbsp; Except this, and the assistance it has given
to the Danish mission in the East Indies, it may be said to have
done little or nothing for foreign countries.&nbsp; Nor let me be
conceived to impute it as blame to this Society that it has done
no more in a sphere, from which, from its constitution, it was
excluded.</p>
<p>But what is the inference from this?&nbsp; That when, from the
introduction of schools at home, an additional demand was created
for the Scriptures, and when abroad the multiplication of
missionaries created a new demand for the Bible, in all the
languages of the earth, it was not sufficient that a Society
existed which had proved itself insufficient for the supply of
the Scriptures, even under less trying circumstances.&nbsp; It
was necessary that something more should be attempted, and,
accordingly, the New Society was constructed&mdash;a Society,
erected on the widest possible basis, and comprehending all the
means and energies of all the worshippers of Christ.&nbsp; The
Old Society was left to pursue its domestic career; and the New
Society, beginning at home, extended itself over the whole
world.&nbsp; The one, as it has been said, is like the lamp at a
particular sanctuary; the other, &ldquo;the pillar which preceded
the march of the whole people of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor is this wider operation and extension of the New Society
the fruit of accident&mdash;<i>it is the result of its
constitution</i>.&nbsp; This constitution acknowledges no sect or
party amongst christians; it partakes of no religious system; and
therefore is equally applicable to all climates and all
governments.&nbsp; Accordingly, in <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Russia, in England, and in America,
in countries divided by the widest intervals in their religious
and political administration, it is equally innoxious to the
established order of things; it arrests every man who bears the
title of a christian; seizes, as by a sort of natural affinity,
upon that part of his creed which he holds in common with the
whole christian world, and throws it down to form as it were a
basis for this institution: he may have much religion, or little;
what he has is converted by this Society to the glory of God, and
the salvation of man.</p>
<p>Nor is the universality of that Society its only peculiar
property&mdash;it is peculiar to that institution <i>to be
incorruptible</i>.&nbsp; Its object is so simple, that it needs
no other safeguards than its own principles.&nbsp; With the Old
Society that is not the case.&nbsp; It is entrusted to human
agents; and how can a person who lives at too great distance to
attend the Committees of this Society, know what Tracts may be
admitted, or what may be suppressed; what security has he for the
consistency of the proceedings?&nbsp; But the object and
proceedings of the Bible Society are always the same.&nbsp; It is
to distribute the authorised version of the Bible, without note
or comment; and whilst it adheres to this, whether the members of
a committee of this Society are well or ill affected to church or
state, nothing more than the distribution of the authorised
version of the Scriptures can be effected.&nbsp; Their deadliest
plot can issue only in the circulation of that book, which is the
best antidote to their own wickedness.&nbsp; In the universality
of its application, therefore, and the incorruptibility of its
plan, the New differs from the Old Society.</p>
<p>But let us now turn to the second objection of the author of
this pamphlet, <i>viz.</i>, <i>That the Bible Society has been
unduly commended by its advocates</i>, page 4,
&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; says our author, &ldquo;is the general
circulation of the Scriptures enacted by them, nor do their
meetings produce love and harmony amongst Christians of various
denominations.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first of those propositions, that
the Scriptures are not distributed
&ldquo;<i>universally</i>&rdquo; by the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Bible Society
is attempted to be proved by this circumstance that they are not
circulated &ldquo;<i>exclusively</i>&rdquo; by it.&nbsp; In what
manner one of three facts establishes the other, I am at a loss
so discover.&nbsp; I heartily wish that, in the like way of
reasoning it could be proved, that because the author is not the
only person who has written against the Bible Society,
<i>therefore</i> he had not written against it at all.&nbsp; But
now look at the fact, as to the distribution of the
Scriptures.&nbsp; They are distributed to all classes, to
heathens even, if they wish to possess them; and they are
distributed not merely in the languages of this country, but in
fifty-three languages or dialects, of almost every kindred and
people over the world.&nbsp; Whatever comes short of a completely
general distribution of the Scriptures by the Bible Society, is
occasioned by the want of funds.</p>
<p>But the author is not satisfied with this gratuitous
assertion.&nbsp; He goes on, in the same strain of independent
and courageous affirmation, to maintain, that a feeling of love
and harmony is not produced by the meeting of various
denominations of christians in this Society; and, in proof of
this, he appeals to certain recent occurrences.&nbsp; But what
are these recent occurrences he leaves us to divine.&nbsp; If,
indeed, he were to refer to certain recent occurrences in another
quarter, as evidences of &ldquo;bitter and unseemly
contention,&rdquo; <a name="citation12a"></a><a
href="#footnote12a" class="citation">[12a]</a> and of the
&ldquo;degradation&rdquo; of a meeting assembled for grave
deliberation into &ldquo;a British Forum, or a Bear
Garden,&rdquo; <a name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a> probably every churchman would
understand the hint, however obliquely conveyed.&nbsp; But, as to
the meeting of the Bible Society, I have attended both those of
the Parent Institution, and in various parts of this and the
neighbouring county, and I can truly say, that I have never seen
any feeling predominate, but that of christian love.&nbsp; I have
never known any offensive peculiarity obtruded upon the assembly;
and although it might have been sometimes wished, that, in points
of taste and expression, some of the speeches <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>had been
amended, yet, in point of temper and spirit, and sober adherence
to the main objects of the meeting, they have admitted of no
improvement.</p>
<p>The author of these observations has, I should suspect, never
attended at a meeting of this Society, or he would not have
hazarded so extraordinary a charge.&nbsp; Let him and his friends
be persuaded to judge in future, rather from their own
experience, than from the representation of others.&nbsp; Let
them come to these meetings, and, as men of feeling and
principle, they would, I am persuaded, be amongst the first to
build up an institution, which they are now in such haste to
destroy.&nbsp; They would find the principle of attraction in the
Society to be as strong as its advocates pretend; would find even
themselves surprised into the vortex, and constrained, by a holy
violence, to love the very men whom now they appear to
distrust.</p>
<p>But I proceed to notice a third class of objections to this
Society, viz.: those which are aimed at it as opposed to the
<i>Established Church</i>, and to the <i>Society in
Bartlett&rsquo;s Buildings</i>.&nbsp; How is this objection
verified?&nbsp; The Society in Bartlett&rsquo;s Buildings had
proceeded for many years with a tolerably even step, and during
the four years preceding the establishment of the Bible Society,
the avenge of its subscriptions and donations was about
&pound;2,234, whilst its whole income was &pound;11,818.&nbsp; If
this New Society had tended to its injury, the subscriptions and
income would of course have diminished.&nbsp; But what is now the
state of the case?&nbsp; The subscriptions to that Society during
the last year amounted to &pound;7,440, and its income to
&pound;44,215.&nbsp; And here let it be observed, that, not only
has the income of the Society increased, but that part of its
income which is applicable to the dispersion of Prayer Books and
Tracts has much more increased.&nbsp; For the national supply of
Bibles, which are in proportion to their sizes, more costly to
the Society than Prayer Books, being at least divided by the
Bible Society, a larger fund must remain for the distribution of
Commentaries and Tracts.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>But we
are taught, by the author, that the Society is injurious to the
Established Church itself.&nbsp; That the Bible may be injurious
to scepticism or superstition is to be believed; but how it can
be injurious to a church, founded upon the Word of Truth, it is
not easy to comprehend.&nbsp; Will the Bible, like the heathen
parent of ancient story, devour his own offspring?&nbsp; But it
is said, that the baptist, or the socinian, will give the Word of
God the colour of their own creed.&nbsp; This, however, the
churchman cannot help.&nbsp; However the baptist, or socinian,
may procure a Bible, he will, of course, put his own
interpretation to it.&nbsp; But we would ask, how are the baptist
or the socinian ever to be converted to what we term
orthodoxy?&nbsp; It must be by appealing to the Word of
God.&nbsp; They will not accept our interpretation of Scripture,
any more than we will theirs.&nbsp; It is, then, only on the Word
of God that we can meet for discussion.&nbsp; This is the only
remedy which we can propose, in ordinary circumstances, for any
error, because it is the only one which the person in error will
allow to be applied.</p>
<p>Let me beg the author to remember the principle upon which our
church is founded.&nbsp; It is an appeal to <i>the
Scriptures</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;We do not,&rdquo; says Bishop
Jewell, <i>Apol. Ecc. Ang.</i>, cap. 4, &ldquo;betake ourselves
to the fire and the sword, but to the <i>Scriptures</i>; nor do
we assault with force of arms, but with the <i>Word of
God</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By the <i>Scriptures</i>,&rdquo; as
says Turtullian, &ldquo;we nourish our faith; by them we erect
our hope; by them we establish our confidence.&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
speaking of the churches of England and of Rome, he says, (cap,
5.) &ldquo;not to mention all the differences, because they are
almost infinite; <i>we have turned the Holy Scriptures into all
languages</i>, and they will scarce allow them to be extant in
any tongue; <i>we invite the people to hear and read the Word of
God</i>, they drive them away from it; we desire the cause in
controversy should be understood by all, but they fly from
judgment; we trust to knowledge, they to ignorance; we bring
truth to light, they to darkness; we venerate, as it is fit that
we <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>should,
the words of the apostles and prophets, they burn
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus we see, that the Scriptures were made the
ground of appeal by our ancestors, when they separated from the
Established Church, and formed our present establishment.&nbsp;
Should we not, therefore, allow others to make the same appeal;
and should we not be content to rest our defence upon the same
ground?</p>
<p>But let us next, in considering the influence of the Society
on the Established Church, take into account certain facts, which
force themselves on the eye of the most cursory examiner.&nbsp;
It is obvious, that the attendance at church in these times is
considerably increased, and certainly not the least increased
where a Bible Society spirit most abounds.&nbsp; In many places,
also, great efforts have been made to build new churches, to
accommodate an overgrown population; and, moreover, a most
extraordinary increase in the circulation of the Liturgy has
taken place.&nbsp; A new Society also has arisen, whose only
object is to distribute the Formularies of the Established
Church.</p>
<p>But we are not yet at the end of the objections of this very
industrious opponent.&nbsp; The meetings of the Bible Society, it
is said, by breaking in a degree the line of demarcation between
churchmen and dissenters, tend to injure the establishment; and
that, although the dissenter may gain, the churchman must lose by
them.&nbsp; But how can this be? can the union of persons, where
the peculiarities of each is kept out of view, have any bearing
upon those peculiarities?&nbsp; Is it the fact, that churchmen
have been converted to dissenters by these meetings?&nbsp; If
there is a danger of conversion taking place, is it not a bad
compliment to the church to suppose that she will be the
loser?&nbsp; In physics, when a larger body meets a less, as in
the case of the heavenly bodies, the smaller never fails to
follow the motion of the larger.&nbsp; Why in the case of the
church and dissenters alone, is this law to be reversed?</p>
<p>Will the author allow me to add this observation, that if
danger to the establishment need not be apprehended from the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>distribution
of the Bible, it is very much to be feared from the conduct of
those who oppose this Society.&nbsp; In the first place, there is
something very awful and ominous, in seeing those who are the
appointed stewards of the Word of God, rising up to oppose any
means by which its circulation is promoted; magnifying mole hills
into mountains, if only they can throw them into the course of
this Society.&nbsp; Opposition, such as this, is well calculated
to shake &ldquo;opinion,&rdquo; upon which every establishment
must mainly, under the blessing of God, depend.&nbsp; May not the
enemies of the church, at least plausibly urge, that the church
cannot be built upon the Scriptures, when so many churchmen
oppose their distribution without their own commentary?&nbsp; And
if the persuasion were established among the poor, that our
church is erected on the foundation of commentaries and tracts,
instead of that of the &ldquo;apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
himself being the chief corner stone,&rdquo; would not popular
attachment quickly dissolve?</p>
<p>There are, however, still two points upon which I would wish
to make a few observations.&nbsp; The first is, as to the
statement of this writer, &ldquo;that the income of the Bible
Society is larger than its expenditure; that a large sum is
invested by this Society in various funds, and, therefore, that
the sum which has been obtained by subscriptions from the poor,
is unjustly taken from them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, to this I answer,
that a large sum has indeed from time to time been invested by
this Society.&nbsp; But, does the Bartlett&rsquo;s
Building&rsquo;s Society, or any other body of men, in their
senses, neglect such a precaution?&nbsp; By referring to the
Report, we shall see that only so much is reserved by the
Society, from year to year, as is necessary to meet the
engagements under which it has laid itself.&nbsp; If the sum of
stock, now stated by the auditors to be possessed by the Bible
Society, is estimated, it will be found hardly more than is
sufficient to pay the &pound;36,000 for which the Society stands
engaged.&nbsp; Had not such a reserve been made in the last year,
from the temporary <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>diminution in the income of the Society, it could not
have fulfilled its engagements.</p>
<p>A second charge is brought against it, on the subject of
<i>Bible Associations</i>.&nbsp; The principle of these
Associations is this&mdash;The poor are permitted to pay one
penny, or more, per week, to supply themselves with a Bible; and
afterwards, if they are so disposed, towards the general funds of
the Society.&nbsp; This is called, by the author of these
Reasons, a &ldquo;vexatious impost,&rdquo; and he adds, that it
is &ldquo;wicked, cruel, and unchristian&rdquo; to &ldquo;deduct
such a sum from a poor family,&rdquo; to &ldquo;tax the paupers
of the kingdom to supply foreign nations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wish my readers and myself to forget the epithets which are
here bestowed upon some of the most respectable persons in this
kingdom; upon the Bishop of Durham, for instance, who is
president of one of these associations.&nbsp; It will be
sufficient for me to reply to the argument upon which they are
founded.</p>
<p>In the first place, it may be observed, that the payment of
the sum of one penny per week, is not at all of the nature of a
&ldquo;tax,&rdquo; or &ldquo;vexatious impost,&rdquo; it is
strictly <i>voluntary</i>.&nbsp; Nor is it
&ldquo;<i>vexatious</i>,&rdquo; for the disposition of man is not
prone to inflict vexatious obligations upon himself.&nbsp; The
days of the flagellants, if ever they existed, are over.&nbsp;
But this charge of the author seems to me to be founded upon a
wrong estimate of the character of the poor, as well as ignorance
of the practical effects of the associations.</p>
<p>It arises, in the first place, from <i>a wrong estimate of the
character of the poor</i>, and especially of the religious
poor.&nbsp; The sympathy which is professed by the author of
these Reasons, is for suffering which only exists in his own
conception.&nbsp; Those who subscribe to Bible Associations have
no feeling of the cruelty which they are said to endure.&nbsp;
The best delight which can animate a human breast, is afforded to
them by the means of the Bible Society, in the easiest manner, as
well as in the highest degree.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Persons
in higher situations of life, are apt to look upon those beneath
them, as incapable of feeling those pleasures which they
themselves enjoy.&nbsp; Thus the clean cottage, the small, but
decorated garden of a poor man, is passed by with indifference by
the rich; yet the poor man has, perhaps, more exquisite pleasure
in his enjoyments, than another, pampered with all the
superfluities of life.&nbsp; So may it be with these small
subscriptions to Bible Associations.&nbsp; Although poor, a man
is equally a man; he has drank &ldquo;milk sweet as charity from
human breasts;&rdquo; and feeling, as acutely as any other, his
own spiritual wants, he may have as earnest desire for the relief
of his fellow-creatures.&nbsp; Such I am persuaded is the state
of many of the poor, and their language in giving to these
Associations is not the pang which <i>cruelty</i> extorts, but of
this kind&mdash;&ldquo;I am not rich myself, but I will give my
money, because I know that he who giveth to the poor, lendeth to
the Lord; because the souls of multitudes are perishing for lack
of that knowledge, which I am able, in a degree, to impart to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But not only is this charge founded upon a wrong conception of
the character and habits of the poor, but upon a mistaken view of
the real political and moral influence of these Associations.</p>
<p>It is admitted on all hands, that the best remedy for national
distress would be to create in the poor a spirit of independence;
to raise them above a state, in which they would stoop to receive
from the public, that support which ought to be procured by their
own industry and foresight.&nbsp; On this ground, we establish
clubs to provide against sickness; banks to deposit savings; and
there is reason to conclude, from the example of Scotland, that
if the principle of honest independence were duly cultivated, and
means supplied for its full operation, an almost total subduction
of our Poor Rate might take place.&nbsp; Bible Associations have,
then, a direct tendency to teach and to set at work this very
principle.&nbsp; They teach the poor economy, a habit <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>of foresight,
the benefit of order and christian co-operation.&nbsp; They raise
the poor from the rank of beggars to that of benefactors; and,
whilst in common with clubs, they cherish a habit of prudence,
they root out the habit of selfishness, which clubs have,
perhaps, a tendency to produce.</p>
<p>I may be permitted to say in conclusion, that although we may
lament that such controversies should arise, because, as the
author of these Reasons states, our divisions are by these means
made greater, still it is our comfort to know, that the effect of
such controversies is to create inquiry into the facts upon which
they are founded.&nbsp; And this inquiry, all that love truth,
must most earnestly desire.&nbsp; The friends of the Bible
Society wish to lay open every fact, to offer every plan for
investigation, conscious of the simplicity and purity of their
object and conduct.</p>
<p>When the members of this Society, those of them, at least, who
are not under an error of judgment, are said in this pamphlet to
&ldquo;have the aim and ambition to puritanize the whole
community, and to raise the fabric of enthusiasm upon the ruins
of church and state,&rdquo; I look to <i>fact</i>, which our
author will at least allow to be as good a weapon as hypothesis,
and having used in vain all my faculties to discover any ground
for the assertion, I venture to conclude, either that the author
has in his study dreamt of enemies whom he cannot have seen, or
that he has inserted this passage for the purpose of concluding
his work with a flourish, even at the expence of truth.</p>
<p>I recollect a fable, by which, some years since, this same
false and foolish charge was illustrated.&nbsp; It said, that
philosophers had fancied they saw a monster in the sun, which,
however, upon further examination, proved to be a fly in their
own glass.&nbsp; And my firm conviction is, that the supposed
monsters in this Society will prove to be flies in the glasses of
our opponents.&nbsp; From no single fact, at least, in the
constitution and general proceedings of the Bible Society, can
these persons shew, that the slightest ground for such portentous
apprehensions as are suggested, does exist, but in their own
imagination.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>The
Bible Society has now existed long enough to prove how vain are
aspersions of this kind.&nbsp; If such suppositions had been
warranted, fourteen years would have developed them; but they
still remain utterly unproved, and this Society is sufficiently
known, and has been sufficiently examined.&nbsp; We have, indeed,
sometimes seen its brilliancy for a short time obscured by works
like our author&rsquo;s, where every thing is charged and taken
for granted, but these clouds have passed away, and then we have,
when they have passed, observed this institution in the mean time
risen to a higher meridian, beaming with more pure and brilliant
lustre, and imparting more extended and beneficent animation.</p>
<p>It is a happiness for the friends of the Bible Society to
know, that opposition like this, is not new against an
institution of the most acknowledged merits; and which has the
testimony of the very writer of these
&ldquo;Reasons.&rdquo;&nbsp; At an early period of the existence
of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, the very same
opposition was raised against itself.&nbsp; In the year 1718,
that Society thought proper to answer these allegations, and I
will extract a passage from a preface which it published to some
missionary letters.</p>
<p>Extract from the Preface to a Collection of Letters from
Foreign Missionaries, part 3, published by the direction of the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.&nbsp; London, 1718,
page vii.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As things of this nature are generally subject to
various opinions and reflections, so hath in particular this
undertaking met with the same treatment since it came to be known
in Europe.&nbsp; It hath been highly approved by some, and
disliked by others.&nbsp; Some, who do not suppose an enterprize
of this nature to be altogether impracticable, do, however, think
it now very improper, when every one <i>complains of hard
tines</i>, and is called upon by <i>other expences nearer at
home</i>; and, for this reason, they are fur putting it off to a
more convenient season.&nbsp; Others have been startled <i>at the
newness of the thing</i> <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>and are shy to venture into a road so
little beaten in this age, and so much exposed to danger and
difficulty.&nbsp; Others have been bare spectators in this
matter, unwilling to judge of a work, which, like a tender blade,
did but just appear above ground, <i>not discovering as yet what
its fruit might prove</i>.&nbsp; Others again, have taken a
transient view of the scheme, but declared their unwillingness to
be farther concerned, till they should see some <i>eminent men
espouse it</i>, and by their example encourage others to engage
in the same.&nbsp; Others are displeased with the heathen
themselves, who, for the sake of a little gain, will conform to
the christian name, but, at the approach of danger, quit it
again, and relapse into their former ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the design of this preface to examine at
large the various opinions and judgments which hitherto have been
passed on this affair, much less to determine how far they might
be well-grounded, or how far, perhaps, they might be biassed by
mistaken and prejudices.&nbsp; However, thus much may be said in
answer to those, who, on the one hand, are so easily terrified by
the common calamities of the times, and, on the other, by the
expensiveness of the design, that they seem to be little
acquainted with the ways and dispensations of Providence.&nbsp;
For if we take a survey of the most considerable transactions,
both under the law and the gospel, it will plainly appear, that,
generally, the <i>best of works have been carried on in the worst
of times</i>, and that they have triumphed at last (though after
much toil and labour) over all the clamours and oppositions that
wicked men and devils could raise against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prophet assures us, that Jerusalem was rebuilt in
strait and troublous times.&nbsp; And another of the inspired
writers tells us, that they were fain to work with one hand, and
to hold their weapons in the other.&nbsp; And yet did the work
gain ground in the midst of all those adversities; and the
attempts made against it, were so far from disheartening the
builders, that they did but more encourage them to go on with
their labour, till <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>they saw the design brought to a happy conclusion.&nbsp;
However, it cannot be denied, that the opposition is then most
destructive and fatal, when it comes from those that are <span
class="GutSmall">WITHIN THE PALE OF THE CHURCH, AND WHO, UNDER AN
EXTERNAL SHEW OF THE SAME CONFESSION, DESTROY THE VITALS OF THE
CHRISTIAN FAITH</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How backward the Jews were in building the Lord&rsquo;s
temple, and under what frivolous pretences they put off so
unwelcome a work, doth plainly appear from the reproof given them
by the prophet.&nbsp; The time is not come, the time that the
Lord&rsquo;s house should be built, was the common plea for their
sloth and drowsiness; but then the effect was, that whilst
governors, priests, and people, were wholly bent on advancing
their worldly interest, and shamefully neglected the Lord&rsquo;s
house, their vines and olives did not yield their increase, and
the earth denied her fruits.&nbsp; All which may possibly
convince us, that even <i>outward prosperity doth in a great
measure depend upon the care employed in the worship of God</i>,
<i>and its enlargement among</i> <span class="GutSmall">JEWS AND
HEATHENS</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor have those a sufficient plea for themselves, that
undervalue a design because it is new, and because it hath been
little attempted by protestants.&nbsp; Truly, this should rather
be an inducement (not to stifle the work in its infancy, but) to
inflame that little of the spirit of power and love, which is
left among us.&nbsp; Should we be also willing to die, because we
see so many dead about us?&nbsp; I mean, so many who are supine
and negligent in the greatest concerns of life and
happiness.&nbsp; Should we not rather strengthen the more the
things which remain, but are ready to die, except they be
supported betimes?&nbsp; Which consideration should make us shake
off that natural drowsiness, which confineth the mind to narrow
ends and purposes, and indisposeth it for any generous
enterprise.&nbsp; Nothing is more common, even among those who
call themselves christians, than to frame new ways and new
methods for increasing their <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>stock, and to improve every
opportunity offered for that end.&nbsp; Almost every year
produceth new schemes, and these new pursuits after the things of
this world.&nbsp; Let a design be never so new and uncommon, it
will soon be embraced, if it be but profitable, and conducive to
some temporal end or other.&nbsp; Why should a christian, then,
be shy of a work because it is new, when it may carry with it a
never-fading reward?&nbsp; Should not he be as ready and watchful
to lay up riches in heaven, as the profane worldling is to
improve his income on earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the opposition once shown to this venerable Society,
and by persons too within the pale of the church.&nbsp; Who these
persons were signifies now as little to us, as the arguments
which they advanced, and which have so happily failed of
success.&nbsp; And such we hope will be the fate of all
objections to the Bible Society.</p>
<p>Could these opposers of the Old Society, now contemplate its
progress, how would they shrink within themselves, and condemn
their own blindness and bigotry.&nbsp; Could they now see the
fields trodden by Ziegenbalgh and Swartz, once &ldquo;a waste
howling wilderness,&rdquo; now &ldquo;rejoicing and blossoming as
the rose,&rdquo; with what anguish would they regard their own
hostility, and how would they bless the author of all good, for
having wrenched the weapons from their hands.&nbsp; Now every
thing is seen by them in its proper colour and dimensions; now
every object is merged in the one great object of the prevalence
of truth.&nbsp; The triumphs of the gospel fills, if we may so
speak, their whole field of vision.&nbsp; Let the opponents,
then, of the Bible Society, learn a lesson from this.&nbsp; For
with them, soon, all the hopes and fears of this world will have
passed away; they will see every object in the light of the
sanctuary, and measure every institution upon its sacred scale:
the world will be nothing, and Christ will be all in all.</p>
<p>May these persons at that awful day be enabled to justify
themselves before that God, who would not that <i>any</i> should
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>perish,
but that <i>all</i> should come to the knowledge of the truth;
before that Saviour who has commanded us to preach his gospel to
all nations, and who, in the glowing language of his own book,
has shadowed out this and similar institutions, under the image
of an angel carrying the everlasting gospel to every nation, and
language, and tongue, and people; before those souls, who are now
crying to us for help&mdash;for that help, which the British and
Foreign Bible Society is seeking to impart.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
